# HBnB Evolution

**HBnB Evolution** is a comprehensive software engineering project designed to replicate the core functionality of an AirBnB-like application. This project serves as a practical implementation of full-stack architecture, focusing on clean code principles, modular design, and robust data management.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design and build a scalable application that manages the lifecycle of:
- **Users:** Registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Places:** Listing properties and descriptions.
- **Reviews:** User-generated feedback and ratings.
- **Amenities:** Tagging system for property features.

## Architecture

The system is designed using a **Layered Architecture** pattern to ensure separation of concerns:

1.  **Presentation Layer:** Handles API services and user interaction.
2.  **Business Logic Layer:** Encapsulates the core models and application rules.
3.  **Persistence Layer:** Manages data storage and retrieval.

Communication between these layers is streamlined using the **Facade Design Pattern**.

## Current Phase: Technical Documentation

We are currently in the design phase, focusing on creating a comprehensive architectural blueprint before implementation. This includes:
* High-Level Package Diagrams.
* Detailed Class Diagrams for the Business Logic.
* Sequence Diagrams for API interactions.

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [`part1/`](./part1/) directory.
